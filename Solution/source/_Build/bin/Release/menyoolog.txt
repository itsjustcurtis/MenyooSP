Menyoo failed to initialise.

Be sure that
- ScripthookV (www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) is installed. 
- An ASI Loader is installed. This is available through the OpenIV app (openiv.com).

If so, check the following logs on GTAV's root folder:

asiloader.log - Should have the below entry
    ASI: Loading "[install path]\Grand Theft Auto V\Menyoo.asi"
     "Menyoo.asi" => [HEX Value]
     
ScriptHookV.log - Should have the below entries
    [Time Stamp] INIT: Registering script 'Menyoo.asi' ([Hex Value])
    [Time Stamp] INIT: Registering additional script thread 'Menyoo.asi' ([Hex Value])    
    [Time Stamp] CORE: Started thread 'Menyoo.asi' ([Hex Value]), id [int] active 1
    [Time Stamp] CORE: Started thread 'Menyoo.asi' ([Hex Value]), id [int] active 1
    [Time Stamp] CORE: Launching main() for 'Menyoo.asi' ([Hex Value]), id [int]
    
If either file is missing you're missing ScripthookV or an ASI loader. If they dont mention Menyoo, its not installed in the right folder.
